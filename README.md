# 🃏 Number guessing game

## 🥂 Welcome ironhacker! 

Today you will develop an amazing game. Check the <code>index.js</code> for all the steps and go one by one. It can feel overwhelming at the beginning, but it's actually very simple!

The general process is:
- You should create a variable (array) with three secret numbers
- You should capture the inputs and their inputs using DOM selectors (like getElementsByClassName)
- You should then transform what is given to us into something that we can compare to the secret numbers
- You should check: 1) The numbers that the user inserted exist in my secret number array? 2) The order is the same?
- Then, you should give some feedback to the user depending on the case
- To finish the game, you should disable the button when the user reaches 10 attempts.
